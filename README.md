## Summary
Festive Cuisines was one of my first major projects I did in 2020 when I first wanted to learn how to do web design.  I touched based on web design by creating this site using an Udemy course that I bought. But I added my own attributes and emphases to this site to be more personal. I named the website Festive Cuisines because I wanted it to be somehthing that sounds like it would be fun to go to and enjoy meals with family and friends. The main colors are orange and white, but there are other colors that just made teh website even more astonishing.  While going through the site there will be a lot of colors, overlays, information, special effects and pictures regarding food. On the home page there are two buttons: order and reservations. Also, there is an about page to introduce the customrs the top chef who has earned many awards, the executive chef, the stationary chef, and the pastry chef which all have contributed as to why 'Festive Cuisines is popular witihin the nation. There is a FAQ for any questions that need to be answer and there is also a contact page to reach the company. Overall, this website is all about trying food that is influences from around the world but now it is easy to access close to home.
